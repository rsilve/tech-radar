  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    The Tech Radar Editor is a visual tool. You can use it to map your technology landscape. The map takes the form
    of a radar on which each blip represents a technology element of your team or organization.
  </p>
  <p>
    For each blip you can place it according to 2 criteria: category and adoption level. The categories are
    "Languages &amp; framework", "Tools", "Platforms &amp; Data" and "Techniques". The adoption levels are "Adopt",
    "Trial", "Assess" and "Hold".
  </p>
  .
  <p>For each blip you will also be able to indicate the evolution trend on the adoption part.</p>

  <p>You can change the position of the blips by simple drag and drop.</p>
