		<h1>Tech Radar editing tool</h1>

		<p>
			With Tech Radar, you can easily create and edit your own technology radar to track trends and new technologies for
			your business or team.
		</p>
		<p>Easy editing: give the information about your technologies and let the radar position them.</p>
		<p>
			Keep up with the trends: Once the map is complete you will be able to identify where to act (sharing, training,
			evolution)
		</p>

		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			The Tech Radar Editor is a visual tool. You can use it to map your technology landscape. The map takes the form of
			a radar on which each blip represents a technology element of your team or organization.
		</p>
		<p>
			For each blip you can place it according to 2 criteria: category and adoption level. The categories are "Languages
			&amp; framework", "Tools", "Platforms &amp; Data" and "Techniques". The adoption levels are "Adopt", "Trial",
			"Assess" and "Hold".
		</p>
		.
		<p>For each blip you will also be able to indicate the evolution trend on the adoption part.</p>
